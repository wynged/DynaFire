## DynaFire
Dynamo Keyboard Shortcuts Extension

## Purpose/Use
Create shortcuts to place commonly used nodes in the workspace.
Shortcuts are 2 letter combinations, press and hold the first letter while pressing the second.  
For example, press 'K', hold it down, then press 'S'.  This opens the keyboard shortcut editing dialog.

## Install
Inside the deploy folder there is an install bat file that should install the extension.  If you don't want to download the whole repo use this link [DeployFolder](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/wynged/DynaFire/tree/master/deploy) to download just the deploy folder. If you use this link, you'll probably need to right click on the zip file, select properties, and then check "unblock" to allow the code to run.

The installer also places a starting saved shortcut file into a user app data folder.  *%AppData&\DynaFire\*  This shortcut file contains all of your customized shortcuts.

This project was started at the #beyondAEC hackathon, held in Boston.

Note, this is very much a work in progress.  At the time of this writing there are known issues. If you find new ones, report them here.
Use at your own risk, and please contribute.  We all want this project to get better :-)
